## Overview

Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning is a technique that utilizes data and algorithms to predict which passengers would survive the sinking of the Titanic. It involves analyzing factors like age, gender, class, and other features to understand what influenced survival rates. Machine learning models, like Logistic Regression, are trained on the historical Titanic data to make these predictions. 

## ✅ Required Modules

Make sure the following packages are installed:

- Python (>=3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (for visualization)

---

## 🛠️ Installation Instructions

### 1. Install Python and an IDE (if not already installed)

- [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any other IDE that supports Jupyter

---

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ajith-ajay/Titanic-Survival-Predection.git
cd Titanic-Survival-Predection
```

**Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

```bash
python -m venv env  # where ene is environment name
```
**Activate the Environment**
For windows
```bash
\env\scripts\activate
```
For macos
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```
**installing libraries**

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib notebook
```

**🚀 Running the Project**
1.Launch Jupyter Notebook
```bash
Launch Jupyter Notebook
```

2. Open and Run the Notebook
    In the browser window that opens, navigate to:
    titanic_survival_pred.ipynb

    Open the file and run each cell to execute the code step by step. shift + enter is the shortcut for the executing the each cell
